CHANGELOG


v 1.4 (May 21, 2022)
======================

First of all, a bug correction to life itself: Turns out that the email address for error reporting has been down for a while. If anyone experienced problems due to this, my sincerest apologies. It is now fixed, and for any questions, bugs, or occasional undeserved praise, ftoutliner@eviltomato.com is once again the address to use!

With that taken care of, today marks the release of a quite substantial rewrite of FTOutliner. It's so substantial that I decided to skip a number and call it 1.4. It's my plugin, I can do that. Anyway, here goes:

NEW FEATURES:
-------------

1. PERHAPS BOTH MOST AND LEAST IMPORTANT: A NEW MENU INTERFACE

   - Commands are now collected in menus, more logically grouped and also with more commands available without remembering a keyboard shortcut. Unless you want to, in which case that still works. You'll find the shortcuts in the menus.
   - Cycle the menus with F1 in case you want to use them but still don't want to take your fingers off the keyboard. We're all different.
   - Oh, and if your system is set to dark mode, menus and dialogs of FTOutliner will follow suite.


2. the NOTE PANEL is a slide-in panel to show a list of all notes in the document. 
   Available from the note menu or by pressing ยง


3. the BONEYARD is a special column where you can drag scenes and sequences you don't know where to put.

   - Add a Boneyard act from the Outline Menu (shortcut CMD + B)
   - Hide/show the Boneyard by clicking it, or using the same shortcut CMD + B once a Boneyard is present

   You can also create your boneyard manually by adding a one-hashtag #ACT at the end of your script and naming it Boneyard, because that's what FTOutliner does when you hit CMD + B. 
   The Boneyard act then changes behavior into a collapsible area that is visually different from the rest of your structure.

   NOTE: Admittedly, this is more of a hack than an actual feature. An actual Boneyard feature would let you store material that would then not print/export together with the non-boneyard stuff.
   Since the Boneyard isn't recognized by Beat itself, whatever you store there will still be considered part of your script and will print with the document.
   So consider the boneyard a storage place for scenes as you work -- still in the document, but visually separated or even hidden from view -- but make sure to manually delete or hide them before distributing.

   (Also, the Boneyard only works in multi-column mode. In one-column mode it just sits like an act at the bottom.)


4. QUITE MASSIVE revision to the INDEX CARD feature:

  ONE SINGLE MODE:
  ----------------
  - Instead of the two index card modes from before (sections or scenes) there is now only one index card mode. 
  - In INDEX CARD MODE, you can now choose to display scenes or sequences independently -- effective emulating either of the two previous modes -- but also anything in between:
    - a. collapsing all scene cards into dots will let you focus on section cards only
    - b. collapsing all section cards into single lines will let you focus on scene cards only
    - c. independently expanding the scenes for any section, or the section card for any group of scenes, or anything in between, lets you seamlessly concentrate on any level as you work
    - d. this sounds complicated. It's not. 
    
    - Shortcut E will alternately expand or collapse all scene cards at once. 
    - Shortcut D will alternately expand or collapse all section cards at once. 
    - The triangle to the left of scenes, and icon in top corner of sections, will toggle that scene group or section card only.

  EDIT, REARRANGE AND ADD NEW INDEX CARDS -- ALL IN THE FTOUTLINER WINDOW
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Drag and drop to rearrange sequences, scenes, or individual synopsises.
  - Synopsis can be edited by double-clicking a synopsis in an index card (names of scenes and sections too, since some versions back)
  - New synopsis can be added by double-clicking the empty area in an index card
  - New index cards (scene or section) can be added directly below any card by holding ALT and selecting the plus button that appears

  RESIZING
  --------
  - Resizing index cards now increases/decreases the number of lines shown, rather than changing it based on aspect ratio as before. This makes zooming in index more predictable and actually useful.

  SO WHAT'S THE POINT WITH ALL THIS THEN? 
  ---------------------------------------
  The idea, should you want to, is that you can now use index cards to outline your story from scratch -- all inside of FTOoutliner. Create cards and write directly into them, on a full-screen index card "board", knowing that everything will be stored as fountain text in your Beat document as you work. 
  This allows you to switch over to normal outline mode at any time -- with FTOutliner next to the normal Beat workspace -- when you feel that you're done using index cards and want to start writing in the document. (But you can of course return to index card mode again should you need to go back to the drawing board and restructure your ideas.)


OTHER IMPROVEMENTS:
-------------------

* DRAGGING-AND-DROPPING has been redesigned and rewritten. It is much more intuitive, much more responsive, and much more reliable. So, yeah.

* NOTES will now show up in FTOutliner even if not on their own line. As a side effect, this also holds true for inline markers and beats (which is a new thing -- see below).
* NOTES can also take on alternate COLORS when displayed in the outline. Default is yellow, but start your note with !, !! or !!! to have it colored in red, purple and magenta. Start with a ? to have it colored green.

* Scenes and sections will now show in color also if you set an arbitrary HEX color. (Hex colors must be set manually by typing in the editor. But still.)
* Using the BEAT color scheme now matches the main app much better, for as seamless an experience as possible:
  - The background is darker, closer to Beat's own sidebar
  - Text on darker colors will have white text to improve legibility
  - The white text thing works in the FTOutliner color scheme too, if you should set some dark HEX color.

* You can EXPAND and COLLAPSE sequences (i.e. show/hide scenes of sections) in non-proportional mode very much like in index card mode.
    - The shortcut is the same as in Index Card mode: Use triangle, or E to toggle ALL scenes between expanded/collapsed.

* Things we may want to set differently for different documents -- view modes, what data to display, and not least the current window position -- are now saved as document defaults rather than plugin defaults. 

* Massive behind-the-scenes rewrite of the outline building code -- allowing for much greater reliability, speed and (which at least makes me a bit happier) easier maintenance. Some of the corrected bugs below wouldn't even have happened with this code to begin with. Hopefully I didn't introduce too many new ones instead. 

* Further improvements to typing speed in sceneheadings and synopsis elements
* Further improvements to speed when selecting colors for scenes, as well as omitting/unomitting from the context menu
* Fixed a bug that would stop scenes from being (re)drawn with flexible heights under certain circumstances
* Fixed a bug whereby adding screenplay text immediately after the first #act element would force a restart of the plugin
* Fixed a bug whereby adding a synopsis at the absolute top of the document would cause a fatal error
* Fixed a bug whereby editing the content of a scene or section would throw an error if the original text included a quotation mark
* Fixed a bug whereby editing the content of a scene or section from the outline could be locked in editing mode if trying to exit by clicking outside


WORK IN PROGRESS:
-----------------

This version contains a few features that are still work in progress. But isn't it the cool thing to do now, to include them in the release anyway and call them beta? 
Well, here goes. The features below will need further testing, so use with caution and expect changes to behavior in upcoming releases. 

* Work in progress: BEATS
  I'm actually semi-hesitant as to whether this is indeed a useful feature, but here it is anyway. It's most likely not very useful when writing, but could potentielly work when communicating to others where some certain beats of some certain story arc take place in the screenplay.
    - To mark the Beats of certain storyline, enter a note with the keyword beat and the name of a storyline: [[beat time travel]]
    - Press B to toggle the display of all beats in the script
    - Beats with the same storyline name will automatically have the same color
    - Hover a beat to display a dashed line combining all beats of the hovered storyline
  Use with care, let me know if you find any use cases for it.
  
* Work in progress: Export outline as HTML. This is extremely bare-bones and probably not useful just yet. But wait and see.



v 1.23 (feb 18, 2022)
=====================

* HOTFIX to solve shortcut key combination for English keyboards. In addition to CMD + PLUS, which still works, FTOutliner now also listens for CMD + EQUAL


v 1.22 (feb 11, 2022)
======================

* HOTFIX to solve issue with sluggish behavior when typing in Sceneheadings or Synopsis.


v 1.2 (jan 25, 2022)
===================

NEW FEATURES:
-------------

* EXPORT OUTLINE TO PDF/PRINT. 
  - Click the print button or press CMD + P to open the print dialog. 
  - The first time you print an outline, FToutliner will try to collect any script title, writer name and other info (like episode number etc) from the title page. You will be offered to change it before printing.
  - To manually enter/change those data, hold ALT to turn the printer icon into a tag icon and click it.
  - LIMITATION: Printing only works with flexible and non-flexible outline modes. Printing index cards is not supported yet.

* HIGHLIGHT SCENES OF CERTAIN COLOR. 
  - ALT + click on a scene to dim all other scene colors (e.g. display only all red scenes)
  - Alternatively, click the funnel to open the tracking dialog and choose a color in the dropdown
  - Add more colors to display by ALT + SHIFT + clicking on scene with another color
  - Hit Esc (or ALT + click anywhere again) to return to normal.

* SELECTION TO NEW DOC
  Context menu item to create a new document populated with the contents of any scenes selected in the outline.
  Example workflow to print all scenes of specific color:
    - ALT-click a colored scene to dim scenes of all other colors
    - press CMD + A to select all non-dimmed scenes
    - right-click (or CTRL + click) on a selected scene to invoke the context menu

IMPORTANT BUG FIX:
------------------

* Fixed a serious issue where repeatedly moving scenes or sequences with synopsis might move contents of next scene with it (effectively breaking it in two). This logic has now been completely rewritten. 

SMALLER CHANGES AND BUG FIXES:
------------------------------

* IMPROVEMENT: Text that are not part of a scene -- i.e. immediately following a section header, without any preceding sceneheading -- will now be reflected in the outline (as their own type of striped quasi-scenes)
* IMPROVEMENT: Markers are recognized even if they contain information after the MARKER COLOR beginning. This way, a marker can read [[MARKER RED: Must rewrite this scene without animals]] and convey the reason the marker is there to begin with. (Note: This is not supported by Beat itself, so if you depend on markers in the document scrollbar do not use this.)
* Improved ways to resize index card heights through toolbar buttons and new keyboard shortcuts to avoid conflict with US keyboards
* Improved parsing logic when moving scenes and sequences
* Improved parsing of notes and markers
* Clicking an element in the outline will now make its heading blink briefly in the editor window for quicker identification
* When initiating a drag to move elements in the outline, the text-to-be-moved will be identified in the editor by temporarily selecting it
* Temporary/partial fix to avoid error when filtering by character, and the character is in a scene which is both omitted AND has a forced scene number 
  (Known issue: Omitted scenes with NO forced scene number, OR scenes with empty scene numbers, will currently still fail to identify the character as present)
* Other fixes to filtering by character: @ before name is disregarded, character name on a hidden/omitted line does not count as present
* Major improvement to reliability in pagecount 
* Fixed a very rare bug that could cause a scene to be displayed with the wrong height
* Fixed a bug that would create an error message when trying to delete a document's last scene from the context menu
* Implemented Beat's new tabbing methods (v 1.929) so that CTRL + Tab and CTRL + SHIFT + Tab switches between tabs in the main window (and with FTOutliner switching along with it)
* Conformed app description data to the new plugin manager
* Cosmetic fixes

* Added undocumented feature (unless you made it all the way down here in this document, but who does?) to display Synopsis inside scenes in normal outline view. When flexible mode is on, Synopsis are shown to the extent that they fit inside the scene box. When off (i.e. in non-proportional mode) scenes actually grow to show the entire synopsis. To toggle this, hit Y for sYnopsis.
* Also added undocumented feature (again meaning not mentioned anywhere else but here) to temporarily toggle off the display of all colors for scenes and sequences. Meant to clearly isolate notes and markers, in case they become drowned out by a busy coloring scheme. Togglable with CTRL + C.


v 1.11 (nov 19, 2021)  
=====================

* Minor cosmetical fixes for older versions of MacOS and to make scrollbars less obtrusive
* Fixed an bug that would display an error if making repeated rapid changes to outline elements


v 1.10 (nov 18, 2021) 
=====================

NEW FEATURES:
------------- 

* SHOW SCRIPT NOTES. Show any full-line [[script notes]] in the outline, positioned relative to their place in the script. (This excludes notes that are inline, i.e. part of an element with actual script text. Multi-line notes are accepted to.)
  Some tips:
  - Toggle the display of notes by hitting "N" or checking/unchecking the corresponding checkbox in settings.
  - Hover a note to see its contents; scroll the script window to a note's position by clicking it.
  - Alternatively, TAB key will cycle through all notes one by one to show their contents.
  - When cycling notes with TAB, the open note remains sticky until you click elsewhere -- and also, a trashcan icon at the top of the note lets you delete it right from there.

* SHOW MARKERS. Any markers in your script as indicated by [[marker color]] will show up as little flags in their appropriate places in your script. Click them to jump directly to that spot. One tip and one caveat:
  - Toggle the display of markers with "M"
  - For now, only full-line markers are recognized. As with notes, in-line markers (i.e. in the middle of a piece of dialogue or action) will not show up.

* MOVE SCENES. Drag-and-drop to re-arrange single scenes, ranges of scenes, or entire sections along with their contents.

* INDEX CARD VIEWS. If you like to outline with 3x5 format cards, there are now two views to allow you to do that: Either with each card representing a SCENE (with any scene-level synopsis visible inside it) or with each card representing a SECTION (with any section-level synopsis visible inside it). Use the "X" key (for IndeX) to cycle to the SCENE index card view to SECTION and back to the normal outline.

* OMIT and UN-OMIT one or more scenes directly via the context menu. 

* DELETE one or more scenes directly from the context menu. You will be warned when you do. But still. Be careful. 

* CHANGE THE FONT SIZE. The plugin's font size can now be increased (cmd + pluskey) or decreased (cmd + minuskey). Reset with cmd + 0. 

* DOUBLE-CLICK a scene or sequence to edit its name (heading) directly in the outline. Admittedly, this may be less effecient than just clicking the scene to jump there and then editing the heading in the script, but it paves the way for future things. Stay tuned.

A NOTE: With this update, FTOutliner will for the first time will be able to make significant changes to the contents of your script. Great care has been taken to test and make sure that FTOutliner does not break anything in your text, but please doublecheck that any changes you do actually end up the way you intended and please report if anything seems incorrect. 
On the bright side, you WILL be able to undo any changes if something doesn't end up the way you wanted it to. Thanks to the fact that Beat listens for (some) shortcuts even when a plugin is in focus, you can do this immediately by pressing cmd+z without switching to the main window, should you want to.

SMALLER CHANGES: 
----------------

* RESPONSIVENESS HAS BEEN MUCH IMPROVED, especially when typing around or in outline elements such as scene headings, sections or synopsis.

* IMPROVEMENT: In modes where not all scenes fit onto the screen at once, typing or clickling a scene in the Beat window will have it scroll into view in FTOutliner if it wasn't already
* IMPROVEMENT: Dimmed scenes are now not dimming child elements. Which is a convoluted way to say that the you-are-here indicator will now show brightly everywhere in the script including in scenes that are dimmed by character tracking.
* IMPROVEMENT: Omitted scenes in a script no longer breaks everything. Instead, they will show as un-numbered, striped-out scenes in Non-Flexible mode, while remaining invisible in Flexible mode (as they are in fact disabled and thus do not take up any time/pagespace anyway)
* IMPROVEMENT: Locked scene numbers (e.g. #44A#) will also not break stuff anymore. Instead, if FTOutliner is set to show scene numbers, locked scenes will be marked with a padlock icon.
* IMPROVEMENT: Previously, FTOutliner behaved badly when a scene had a synopsis present anywhere but immediately following the scene hading. This has now been improved. 

* FIX: A # character inside a section name (e.g. #ACT #2) will not be counted as a leading # and thus not increase the section level anymore.
* FiX: An empty screenplay document will not cause an error anymore but make FTOutliner display a welcome message. 
* FIX: Temporary workaround to allow apostrophes in a character name (e.g. LINN'S DAD) without breaking character tracking
* FIX: Scenes that are too small to show their sceneheading will now sport a better popup with the slugline info when hovered, while scenes that do have their heading written out will have no popup at all because why would they. 
* FIX: Hitting ESC with context menu open now closes the menu rather than the entire plugin
* FIX: A bunch of internal changes because hey. You live and you learn.

* CHANGE: Clicking a scene will not only scroll to that place, but the scene is now also selected in the plugin view. It will be deselected again as soon as focus is moved from the plugin to the document, but helps with the UX logic when selecting a range of scenes.
* CHANGE: The "special" color option in the context menu now only shows in the context menu when a sequence is selected. The "special" color means nothing to Beat, but is shown in FTOutliner as a transparent sequence, pretty much like an act but *without* starting a new column. This is useful for special dividers inside acts, such as ##NEW DAY or whatever other reason you might have for wanting a visual spacer.
* CHANGE: FTOutliner will now ask before closing. 


v 1.01 (July 29, 2021)
=====================
* FIX: If screenplay does not start with an #ACT, scenes and ##sequences before any #ACT will now be stacked vertically too
* IMPROVEMENT: Character list updates every time the Tracking dialog is opened, with any character already currently selected for tracking automatically reselected.


v 1.0 (July 27, 2021)
=====================
Initial release
